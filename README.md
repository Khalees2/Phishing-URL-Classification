# Phishing-URL-Classification-using-Machine-Learning
To identify and extract features from URL that help classify URLs into benign/phishing and train an Machine learning model with these features for classification.

# Assignment Problem Statement
Researching and collecting an appropriate set of benign URLs and phishing URLs. To train your classifier you will need to extract a set of features from each URL. Researching and selecting an appropriate set of features for extraction forms this task.
Credit will be given for incorporating dynamic features (i.e. ones not generated directly from the URL). You might for example use Python to programmatically perform DNS and/or whois lookups on a domain and transform the resultant answers into features associated with each URL. The choice of features is up to you and part of the research. Your report should include an assessment of which features were found to be most salient.
Your research will reveal that a variety of machine learning algorithms have been applied to the URL classification problem. Credit will be given for comparing the performance of 2-3 such algorithms in your paper.
